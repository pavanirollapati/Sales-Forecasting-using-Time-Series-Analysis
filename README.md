# Sales-Forecasting-using-Time-Series-Analysis
The Sales Forecasting using Time Series Analysis project focuses on predicting future sales trends by analyzing historical sales data through time series techniques, enabling businesses to make informed inventory and financial decisions.
 The project involves several key steps:
 
 Project Objective: The Sales Forecasting using Time Series Analysis project aims to predict future sales trends based on historical sales data, enabling businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory and financial planning.
 
Data Collection: Collected a comprehensive dataset containing sales transactions, including attributes such as Order Date, Sales Amount, Product ID, and Customer Information to ensure a robust analysis.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and formatting issues, ensuring the dataset is ready for time series analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns in the sales data through visualizations such as line graphs and seasonal decomposition.

Time Series Decomposition: Decomposed the time series data into its components (trend, seasonality, and residuals) to better understand underlying patterns affecting sales.

Model Selection: Evaluated various time series forecasting models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet to determine the most suitable approach for accurate predictions.

Model Training: Trained the selected model(s) on historical sales data while tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance and improve forecasting accuracy.

Forecast Generation: Generated future sales forecasts using the trained model(s), projecting sales for specified future periods based on historical trends.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure reliability of the forecasts.

Visualization and Reporting: Created visualizations of forecast results alongside actual sales data to present findings clearly, enabling stakeholders to understand trends and make informed strategic decisions.
